I am Hao-Ming Hsu, now studying Computer Science in the National Taiwan University. Site reliability engineering (SRE) and cloud-native application development are main subjects I'm focusing on.

As a passionate developer, I enjoy learning new things and sharing them with developer communities. I gained experience in microservice, database and DevOps throughout my internships. Thus, I'd like to share my thoughts and some learning notes in this blog. Further dicussion is welcome under each post!
