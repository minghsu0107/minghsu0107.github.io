I am Hao-Ming Hsu. Site reliability engineering (SRE) and cloud-native application development are main subjects I'm focusing on.

As a passionate developer, I enjoy learning new things and sharing them with developer communities. Thus, I'd like to share my thoughts and some learning notes in this blog. Further dicussion is welcome under each post!
